A Myntra Clone I created to test my java and mysql skills.

It is a desktop application developed using Java in Netbeans IDE using JDBC. MySQL has been linked as a database for storing data of accounts and purchases. It provides a professional interface to browse and buy apparels. It boasts 10+ fashion brands and a wide range of 120+ apparels to choose from, all ranging between different gender and sizes. It has a cart to view your selected products and shipping system to save your address and card details.
